<p>Promotions allow you to offer discounts and special offers to your customers. The system evaluates active promotions during checkout and automatically applies the best available discount.</p>
<p>To learn how to create and manage promotions in the administration, see <a href="/documentation/business-users/manage-commerce-stores#manage-promotions">Manage promotions</a>.</p>
<p>Xperience by Kentico provides a promotion framework that allows developers to implement custom discount rules. The framework integrates with the <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/price-calculation">price calculation API</a> to automatically apply promotions during checkout.</p>
<h2 id="promotion-types">Promotion types</h2>
<p>The system supports different types of promotions based on when and how discounts are applied:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Promotion type</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Description</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Use cases</p>
</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/promotions/catalog-discounts">Catalog discounts</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Discounts applied to individual products during price calculation. The system evaluates all applicable promotions and automatically selects the best discount for each product. Only one promotion can apply per product.</p>
</td>
<td>
<ul>
<li>Percentage discounts (10% off coffees)</li>
<li>Fixed amount discounts ($5 off)</li>
<li>Category-based promotions</li>
<li>Member-only pricing</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/promotions/order-discounts">Order discounts</a></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Discounts applied to the entire order total. Order discounts are evaluated after catalog discounts and can be combined with product-level promotions. Only one order discount can apply per order.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Order total discounts based on shopping cart contents, total price, etc.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<h2 id="discount-applicability-and-priority">Discount applicability and priority</h2>
<p>Discounts in Xperience can be combined and stacked in various ways. Promotions are evaluated during the price calculation pipeline:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<strong>Catalog discounts</strong> are evaluated first, applying product-level discounts based on configured promotion rules. The system evaluates all applicable promotions and automatically selects the best discount for each product.</li>
<li>
<strong>Order discounts</strong> are evaluated after product prices are calculated, applying order-level discounts to the total. The system evaluates all applicable order-level promotions and selects the highest eligible discount, applying it to the order total.</li>
</ol>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>The selected <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/price-calculation/implementation#calculate-prices">price calculation mode</a> also determines what types of promotion are evaluated. For example, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/price-calculation/implementation#catalog-price-calculation">catalog price calculation</a> applies catalog discounts only. Additionally, the entire calculation pipeline can be <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/price-calculation/customization#create-a-custom-steps-provider">customized</a> to your preference.</p>
</div>

<p>The <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/checkout-process/order-creation">order creation service</a> persists promotion data with orders for reporting and order history. Viewing order details in the <strong>Orders</strong> application provides a breakdown of each applied discount and its impact on the overall unit and order prices.</p>
<p></p>
<h2 id="redemption-methods">Redemption methods</h2>
<p>Promotions support two redemption methods that control how customers receive discounts:</p>

<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p>Redemption method</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Description</p>
</td>
</tr>
</thead>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Automatic</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>The default behavior. Promotions are automatically evaluated and applied during price calculation when customers meet the configured conditions.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
<p><strong>Generic discount code</strong></p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Requires customers to enter a specific code (e.g., <em>WINTER20</em>) to receive the discount. The promotion is only applied if the customer provides the matching code.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>

<p>Coupon codes can be configured for both catalog discounts and order discounts. For implementation details, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-commerce-setup/promotions/coupon-codes">Coupon codes</a>.</p>
