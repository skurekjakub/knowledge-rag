<h2 id="access-deployed-applications">Access deployed applications</h2>
<p>After successfully <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#upload-a-deployment-package-to-your-xperience-portal-project">uploading the deployment package</a> to the QA environment or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deploying the package to another deployment environment</a>, use the application URL displayed in the <strong>Deployments</strong> application under <strong>Latest deployments</strong> to access the deployed application.</p>
<p>Each project has a default system domain in format: <em><strong>&lt;environment&gt;-</strong>&lt;project_code_name&gt;.<strong>xperience-sites.com</strong></em></p>
<p>The default domain can be used to access the project’s administration UI by appending the <em>/admin</em> path to the URL. You can view your project’s default system domains or <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/email-configuration#custom-system-email-domains-in-the-saas-environment">customize</a> your system Email sending and Email service domain in the <strong>Channels and Domains → System domains</strong> application in Xperience Portal.</p>
<p>Additionally, projects also have domains for individual website and email channels. You can set up custom domains for website and email channels in the PROD or STG environment. To learn more, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#manage-channel-domains-in-xperience-portal">Website channels in the SaaS environment</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/digital-marketing-setup/email-channel-management#manage-email-channel-domains-in-xperience-portal">Email channels in the SaaS environment</a>.</p>
<h2 id="restart-deployed-applications">Restart deployed applications</h2>
<p>If you encounter any issue that requires you to restart the Xperience by Kentico application, you can <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/system-overview#restart-the-application">restart the application</a> in the administration interface. However, when you cannot access the administration interface, you can restart the application from Xperience Portal.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal#XperiencePortal-AccessPortal">Access your Xperience Portal project</a>.</li>
<li>Navigate to the <strong>Deployments</strong> application.</li>
<li>
<strong>Restart</strong> the desired environment.
<ul>
<li>For non-production environments (<strong>QA</strong>, <strong>UAT</strong>), the <em>Restart</em> button is available to all portal users. However, only users in <strong>Tenant Administrator</strong> or <strong>DevOps Engineer</strong> <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/saas/xperience-portal/reference-xperience-portal-user-roles">roles</a> can restart production environments (<strong>PROD</strong>, <strong>STG</strong>).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Wait until the restart is finished.</li>
</ol>
<p></p>
<h2 id="channel-management">Channel management</h2>
<p>Content in Xperience by Kentico is encapsulated within channels, which are bound to specific domains. To allow the content to be presented by deployments in the SaaS environment, you need to add and configure all website and email channels within Xperience Portal in the <strong>Channels and Domains</strong> application.</p>
<p>For detailed information, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management#website-channels-in-the-saas-environment">Website channels in the SaaS environment</a></li>

</ul>
<h2 id="restore-points-and-exports">Restore points and exports</h2>
<p>The SaaS environment uses a two-tier system consisting of <strong>restore points</strong> and <strong>exports</strong> to ensure data protection and disaster recovery. This system allows you to restore previous versions of your project for a particular environment.</p>
<p>Xperience Portal creates <a href="#automatic-restore-points-and-exports">automatic restore points and exports</a>, and you can also create <a href="#create-a-manual-restore-point">manual restore points</a> and <a href="#create-a-manual-export">manual exports</a> for production and non-production environments. Restore points and exports are managed in separate applications:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Restore points</strong> can be viewed, managed and <a href="#restore-from-a-restore-point">restored</a> under <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Restore points</strong>
</li>
<li>
<strong>Exports</strong> can be created and downloaded under <strong>Data Management</strong> → <strong>Exports</strong>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The separate Restore points and Exports applications are available for projects with version <strong>30.1.0 or higher</strong> deployed across all environments. Projects with earlier versions continue to use the combined <strong>Backups</strong> application.</p>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p>Applications deployed in the SaaS environment consist of the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Application service</strong> – application binaries and runtime files</li>
<li>
<strong>Database</strong> – reflects the current state of the environment’s database</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage</strong> – reflects the current state of files in the environment’s Azure Blob storage</li>
</ul>
</div>

<h3 id="restore-points-vs.-exports">Restore points vs. exports</h3>
<p>Understanding the difference between restore points and exports is crucial for effective data management:</p>
<p><strong>Restore points:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A timestamp referencing the application state at a given time, allowing you to restore the application to that previous state</li>
<li>Fast to create as no physical data copying occurs</li>
<li>Always include restore points for all three services (application, database, and storage)
<ul>
<li>An Application service restore point is a snapshot of the deployment package. If nothing has been deployed yet, you can download the intial Application service files</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Created automatically before deployments, manually on demand, or on a regular schedule</li>
<li>Cannot be used to download data (with the exception of <em>Weekly restore points</em>). To download data, you must create an export.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Exports:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Physical copies of data that can be downloaded for inspection, debugging, or long-term storage</li>
<li>Slower to create (depends on the amount of data) as files are physically copied</li>
<li>Can be full (all components) or partial (selected components only)</li>
<li>Cannot be used to restore the application</li>
<li>Service components included in exports:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Application service</strong> – copy of all files from the application service file system</li>
<li>
<strong>Database</strong> – exported as a <code>bacpac</code> file</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage</strong> – copy of files from Azure Blob storage</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Limited to <strong>30 exports per component</strong> per environment per month (may be adjusted with custom plans)</li>
<li>Exported files are retained for <strong>60 hours</strong> after creation and must be downloaded before automatic removal</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="automatic-restore-points-and-exports">Automatic restore points and exports</h3>
<p>Kentico automatically creates the following <strong>restore points and exports</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>For all environments:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Pre-deployment restore points</em> which expire in 30 days. The system creates a restore point for each service to make deployments faster:
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Application service</strong> – if nothing has been deployed yet, an export of the current application service file system is created instead</li>
<li>
<strong>Storage</strong> – restore points are always created</li>
<li>
<strong>Database</strong> – restore points are created only when all project environments have Xperience by Kentico version 30.1.0 or higher deployed and all existing backups are from 30.1.0 or higher</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the <em>Staging</em> or <em>Production</em> environment:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Daily restore points</em> with a retention policy based on your service plan:
<ul>
<li>
<em>Level 1</em> – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Level 2</em> – 3 days</li>
<li>
<em>Custom</em> – 7 days or more</li>
<li>Daily backups always use restore points only</li>
<li>Application service restore points are snapshots of the deployment package. If no deployment package has been deployed yet, the daily backup may contain a downloadable application service <a href="#restore-points-vs.-exports">export</a> instead.</li>
</ul>

<div>

</div>
<div>
<p><strong>QA environment daily backups</strong></p>
<p>All standard service plans (<em>Level 1</em>, <em>Level 2</em>) have QA daily backup retention set to 0 days, so the QA environment does not have any daily backups. Only <em>Custom</em> service plans can configure QA daily backup retention.</p>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<em>Weekly restore points</em> (created on Sundays) with a retention policy of 30 days
<ul>
<li>Weekly restore points also include downloadable export data for all components</li>
<li>This allows you to download the data for long-term storage purposes while also providing fast restore point functionality</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<div>

<p>To view alerts for your project’s deployments, navigate to <strong>Monitoring → Alerts</strong> in <a href="https://xperience-portal.com" target="_blank">Xperience Portal</a>. You can filter the alerts for individual deployment environments, based on the time when the alert was fired, and the alert severity.</p>
<p>Alerts are displayed with the <strong>Resolved</strong>  flag if the conditions that caused the alert to fire no longer apply. For example, a <em>CPU utilization</em> alert will be resolved after the average utilization drops under the 80% threshold over 30 minutes. Select <strong>Show active alerts only</strong> in the filter if you wish to see only unresolved alerts.</p>
<p></p>
<h4 id="alert-email-notifications">Alert email notifications</h4>
<p>Whenever an <a href="#alerts">alert</a> is fired, the system sends a notification email to all Xperience Portal users assigned to the related project.</p>
<p>Individual users can adjust their preferences for receiving alert email notifications:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>In <a href="https://xperience-portal.com" target="_blank">Xperience Portal</a>, expand the top-right user menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Notifications</strong>.</li>
<li>Customize for which alert types and severities you want to receive email notifications from each <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-the-saas-environment#deploy-the-package-to-another-deployment-environment">deployment environment</a>.
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Note</strong>: The selected alert severity and alert type conditions are combined using an <em>AND</em> statement. If you select <em>Critical</em> alert severity and <em>CPU</em> alert type, you will not receive any alerts of alert types other than <em>CPU</em>. For <strong>Production</strong> and <strong>Staging</strong> environments, it is recommended to enable all alert types and at least <em>Critical</em> and <em>Error</em> alert severity.</li>
</ul>
