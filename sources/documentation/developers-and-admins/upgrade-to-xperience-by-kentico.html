<p>The following table and diagram outline the main differences in the <strong>architecture</strong> of the Xperience products.</p>

<p>Consists of two separate applications – one for the live site and one for the administration.</p>
<p>The live site application can be built using <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/mvc/overview/getting-started/introduction/" target="_blank">ASP.NET MVC 5</a> or <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/introduction-to-aspnet-core" target="_blank">ASP.NET Core</a> (as part of .NET Core 3.1 or newer).</p>
<p>The administration application is based on <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/web-forms/" target="_blank">ASP.NET Web forms</a>.</p>
</td>
<td>
<p>Both the live site and administration run as a single application, based on the current .<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/installation/system-requirements">NET version requirements</a>.</p>
<p>The Xperience administration is integrated into the application via a <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/website-development-basics/configure-new-projects/xperience-by-kentico-nuget-packages">NuGet package</a>. It is possible to <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/deployment/deploy-to-private-cloud/deploy-without-the-administration">deploy sites without the administration</a>.</p>

<h3 id="major-differences">Major differences</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Sites</strong> – sites are no longer used in Xperience by Kentico. Instead, websites are represented by <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/website-channel-management">website channels</a>.</li>
<li>
<strong>Cultures</strong> – multilingual functionality and content is based on <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/configuration/languages">languages</a> that users configure in the system.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="api">API</h3>
<p>Xperience by Kentico preserves a large part of the Kentico Xperience 13 API and general code patterns, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/database-table-api">Info and InfoProvider API</a> and custom <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/object-types">object types</a>
</li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/objectquery-api">ObjectQuery</a></li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/page-builder">Page Builder components</a></li>
<li><a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/development/builders/form-builder">Form Builder components</a></li>
<li>
<a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/handle-global-events">Event handlers</a> (with differences in the available events, see <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/handle-global-events/reference-global-system-events">Reference - Global system events</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>However, the Page API and data structure is completely different. See <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-query-api">Content item query API</a>, <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-retriever-api">ContentRetriever API</a> and <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/api/content-item-api/content-item-database-structure">Content item database structure</a>.</p>
<p>Xperience by Kentico currently provides a smaller, more focused set of features than Kentico Xperience 13. Correspondingly, there are differences in the API due to unavailable features, or features with a different scope and capabilities.</p>
<p><strong>See also</strong>: <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico/editing-components-in-xperience-by-kentico">Editing components in Xperience by Kentico</a></p>
<h3 id="administration">Administration</h3>
<p>The Xperience by Kentico administration is based on .NET and uses <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank">React.js</a> as its UI framework. This is a major change from the Kentico Xperience 13 administration built using Web Forms.</p>
<p>The administration can be customized and extended, as described in <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/customization/extend-the-administration-interface">Extend the administration interface</a>. However, customizations of the Kentico Xperience 13 administration UI are incompatible due to the different technology stack.</p>
<h2 id="migrate-from-other-platforms">Migrate from other platforms</h2>
<p>You can migrate your projects to Xperience by Kentico from other platforms outside of the Kentico ecosystem, like Sitecore or Sitefinity. To simplify the process, use the respective <a href="/documentation/developers-and-admins/upgrade-to-xperience-by-kentico/migration-toolkit">Migration tool</a>. Each tool can be further customized to satisfy specific project requirements.</p>
